Do you know that every year, each person in France throws away about 30 kg of food, and 7kg of the food is still-packaged food products. It costs around 100 euro/person/year, therefore the cost of food waste for a family of 4 people is 400 euros.The total cost for food waste is 12 to 20 billion euros/year.

In the other hand, regarding to a research of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 2014, overweight and obesity rates in France are among the lowest in Europe, but have been increasing steadily. One in 8 adults is obese in France, and 40% are overweight (including obese).

Do you think two things below is concerned? We can say yes! When you buy more than you need and eat more than your body can absorb, you waste your money because you will throw the products when it is near the expiration date, or you try to eat more than you can, which is worse for your health.

By introducing our project, we want to make an application that help people to control their weight, reduce food waste in their fridge and also save their money.
